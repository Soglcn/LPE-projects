# LPE-projects
Welcome to the LPE-Projects repository!

In an effort to enhance my Python skills, I embarked on a journey to develop practical programs that can simplify everyday tasks. Each project in this collection is designed to address common, small-scale problems through clean and efficient Python code.

By creating these applications, I not only aim to strengthen my understanding of Python but also to create tools that can be useful for daily life. This repository serves as both a personal learning experience and a showcase of functional, easy-to-use programs.

## Projects 
------
• **LPE1 - Day Converter**: Convert days into various time units (e.g., hours, minutes).

• **LPE2 - Kilograms to Pounds**: A simple tool for converting kilograms to pounds and vice versa.

• **LPE3 - Sleep Calculator**: A program to calculate optimal sleep schedules.

• **LPE4 - Increase Calculator**: Calculate percentage increases for quick financial analysis.

## Practises
------
In addition to the projects above, the **practises** folder contains code snippets and exercises created specifically for student training. These are aimed at helping to solidify Python fundamentals, improve problem-solving skills, and enhance coding practices through a variety of challenges and learning experiences.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue adding new projects to this collection!
